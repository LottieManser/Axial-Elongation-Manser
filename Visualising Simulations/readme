VISUALISING SIMULATIONS

These were all run locally on my laptop.

The most important script here is Animate_tracks.py, which plots the output .csv files from main.py using Mayavi.
Find_Cell_Tracking.py outputs single frames for each simulation (e.g used in Fig. 3.2 in my master's report).
nearest_neighbours_analysis.py outputs does what it says on the tin.
